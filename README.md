“Am I safe?” 

Maybe you know you’re way around maybe you are new to an area. For women finding the saftest way to simply walk outside is something that we have to think about as commonly as we do traffic. 
As a team we wanted to design a platform for women to mark where they have felt uncomfortable and a way to navigate through the world with other women’s experience taken into account. How would you advise your friend to get home? “This road is well lit, stay away from that bus stop in front of the liquor store.” What would someone want their daughter to know? A family member?

By collecting this data we can look out for each other, as well as notify lawmakers and business owners about potential problems. Yes, all women, and #metoo can have live data points of what women’s daily experience, and a potent conversation piece when combating non-believers. 

Our team sees this concept having the potential to grow into a way to study women’s safety, and even potentially be a social accountability system very much so like yelp. “Lets go for drinks! This place has good food and a place other women recommend.”  We are hoping this social pressure of not having multiple reports of bad experiences will push business owns to “hold the public space” better and actively look out for predators. Maybe even hold trainings for employees to notice when women are recipients of relentless unsolicited attention.  
Honestly,  a world that is safer for women is net safer for all folks of all genders, and we would hope that this can act as a model for all people to get home safe.
